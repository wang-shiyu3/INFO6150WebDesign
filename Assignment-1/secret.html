		<p>Only 14 degrees south of the equator, Trinidad is a lively, tropical city (population 90,000) in north-central Bolivia and a starting point for great rainforest cruises and wildlife expeditions around the Mamoré River Basin. Situated 550 kilometers northwest of Santa Cruz on a paved road, Trinidad is the capital of the department of Beni, and de-facto capital of the Bolivian Amazon.<br>Trinidad lies in the headwaters region of the Amazon in northeastern Bolivia, 2,000 miles from both the river's source high in the Andes and its mouth at Belen, Brazil. But, unlike Iquitos in Peru, or other Amazonian towns in neighboring countries, ocean-going ships cannot venture upriver to Bolivia.<br>Founded as a Jesuit mission in 1686 under the name Santísima Trinidad, it was the second mission to be founded in the Moxos region, which is now part of the department of Beni. Its original position on the shores of the Río Mamoré proved too precarious, and it was moved to its current location in 1769, two years after the Jesuits were ejected from the region.<br>
